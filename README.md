# SkyChecküå§Ô∏è

The purpose of this project is to create a weather application called "SkyCheck" that allows users to **enter a city name** and **view its current weather**, including **temperature**, **visibility**, **wind speed**, **humidity**, and **sunrise/sunset times**. The application also displays **a 6-hour weather forecast** and an **interactive map** showing the location of the city.

# Technologies:
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the web pages.
  
# Libraries/Frameworks:
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js to handle routing and middleware.
- EJS: A templating language to generate HTML markup with JavaScript.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/): A JavaScript library for interactive maps.

# External services:
- [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/): An external API to fetch weather data. To utilize the WeatherAPI service, it is essential to obtain an API key. This key is required to authenticate your requests and access the weather data provided by the API.

 # Tools:
- dotenv: A module to load environment variables from a .env file.
- Body-parser: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies.
